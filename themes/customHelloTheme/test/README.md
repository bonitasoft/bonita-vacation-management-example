# Bootstrap page example

## Purpose
This html page can be used to preview the look of your custom theme for bootstrap components.
It is not meant for other purposes. 
Additional assets in the `js` and `css` folder are only used for this page and must not be added in the built archive.
All bootstrap javascript dependencies are already provided by the Bonita runtime environment.

## References
This page is greatly inspired by the [bootswatch](https://github.com/thomaspark/bootswatch/tree/v3.3.7/default) theme preview.
